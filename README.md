# Blog App

The Blog app is a classic example of a blog website. I have created a fully functional website that will show the list of posts and empower readers to interact with them by adding comments and liking posts.

Things you may want to cover:

# Ruby version
`ruby 3.0.4`

# System dependencies
- Node
- Ruby
- Rails
- Git

# Configuration
- **Run app**
  - ``rails server``

# Database creation
  - ``create database blog_app``

# How to run the test suite
  - Ruby linter test: ``rubocop``
  - Style linter test: ``npx stylelint "**/*.{css,scss}"

# How to run tests
  - Use Rspec gem to test our code.
  - You can run those tests locally if you follow the steps:
    - install all the gems running : ``bundle install``
    - to run the file use : ``rails server``
    - and then run: ``rspec``.

### Testing

In order to run tests for this project make sure you have installed all previously mentioned [prerequisites](#prerequisites) section, then run the code below.

- Run all tests
  - This should run all tests using 'RSpec-Rails' and (in some cases) 'Capybara'
  ```sh
  bundle exec rspec
